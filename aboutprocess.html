Welcome to Spotisave.</h1><h1 class="header">The Story</h1><div class="text">Spotify has this amazing feature called "Discover Weekly" and I use it often. I find that I listen to my Discover Weekly playlist more than I listen to any of my favorite artists. That is to say, a lot.<br><br>The one caveat is that it gets deleted once a week, every week, to be replaced with something that is probably equally amazing.<br><br>When that first happened to me, I started spending a few minutes every week to back up my Discover Weekly into a new playlist. And it was <i>annoying.</i><br><br>I took the opportunity to finally learn about RESTful APIs, and along the development of <a href="https://github.com/davshus/export-discover-weekly" target="_blank">a script to automate the process</a>, I learned countless other useful skills such as:<ul><li>node.js</li><li>Gulp</li><li>Express</li><li>OAuth</li><li>HTTP requests</li><li>Promises</li></ul>and more. Finally, I decided to make a <a href="https://github.com/davshus/spotisave">user-friendly website</a> rather than a more obscure and esoteric command line app. I also took the opportunity to incorporate even more learning experiences into my project, such as:<ul><li>ES2017 (async/await)</li><li>Babel</li><li>AJAX requests</li><li>Browserify</li><li>UglifyJS, CleanCSS, HTMLMin</li><li>Challenging myself by creating my own CSS rather than using a library such as Bootstrap, Angular Material (or any other Material Design implementation).</li><li>SVG and SVG animation</li></ul>I originally set out to use only vanilla JavaScript as a challenge, but I decided that not using jQuery at the very least would be overly difficult for the original release. Who knows, I might come back and implement my own methods to avoid using the entirety of jQuery. That could take a lot of weight off of the load time.<br>So Spotisave is more of a learning project or a demo than a business or a start-up. Don't worry, though! It's perfectly functional, so feel free to use it.</div></div><div id="footer">&copy; David Shustin 2017 | <a href="about.html">About</a> | <a href="https://github.com/davshus/spotisave" target="_blank">Source Code</a> | <a href="https://github.com/davshus" target="_blank">Github</a></div></div></body></html>
